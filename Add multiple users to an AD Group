# Easiest way to add members to a group is to use the following script, provided you know the SAM Account Name for the members you wish to add and there's not many.
# One of the few instances of a plural parameter in memberS.

Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "group name" -Members SAMAccoutName,SAMAccountName

# Better option for a larger number to add to a group is to first get the users based on a filter, and then add them to the group. 
# To get the users, use the Get-ADUser cmdlet, specifying the users we wantin the new group by job title, then pipe those users into a new-adgroupmember loop.

Get-ADUser -Filter "title -eq 'manager'" | ForEach-Object { Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "research" -Members $_ }
